# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

## Learn More

You can learn more in the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).

## Backend Environment & Secrets

The backend (`backend-api/`) now uses `dotenv`.

1. Copy `backend-api/.env.example` to `backend-api/.env` and fill in values.
2. Never commit the real `.env` (it's ignored by `.gitignore`).
3. Rotate any leaked secrets immediately.

### Example
```
PORT=5002
JWT_SECRET=GENERATE_A_LONG_RANDOM_STRING
ADMIN_USER=admin
ADMIN_PASS=CHANGE_ME
JOURNAL_TOKEN=CHANGE_ME
APP_URL=http://localhost:3001
SERVER_BASE=http://localhost:5002
```

## Secret Scanning

Automated scans run via GitHub Actions workflow: `.github/workflows/secret-scan.yml` using Gitleaks.

Local pre-commit hook (optional):
```
cd backend-api
bash scripts/add-gitleaks-hook.sh
```
Install gitleaks first (see https://github.com/gitleaks/gitleaks#installation).

If a commit is blocked, review and remove/rotate the exposed value.

## Uploads

User avatar images are stored in `backend-api/uploads/` (git-ignored) and served at `/uploads/<file>`.

## Hardening Suggestions

- Enforce non-default `JWT_SECRET` on startup.
- Add rate limiting to avatar upload.
- Implement DELETE `/profile/avatar` when needed.
