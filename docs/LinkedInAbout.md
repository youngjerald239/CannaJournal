Product‑minded Full‑Stack JS developer who ships end‑to‑end features—UX through API to deploy. I built canna‑bee, a media‑rich React + Node/Express app with a public feed, multi‑file uploads (progress/compression), and an admin guides hub. The backend uses Postgres with migrations and tokenized media ([media:UUID]) hydrated on read. The stack runs in Docker with Nginx and S3‑compatible storage (AWS S3 or MinIO), including a migration tool to move local uploads to object storage. I enjoy building pragmatic systems with clean UX, security basics (CSP, CORS, rate limits), and production‑style deployment.
